        <h1>Welcome to @ :: FileMaker SQL Sugar</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>"@" is a fluid and nimble SQL power tool designed expressly for FileMaker developers.</p>

<p>Bringing a fresh perspective to FileMaker SQL ("FQL"), @ offers a deep set of tools to help ensure that code written is unbreakable and well structured in any manner a FileMaker developer chooses.</p>

<p>Drawing on tools like Markdown, jQuery, and CoffeeScript, @ offers a nimble, chainable SQL syntax that eliminates the clutter currently associated with FQL. And @ outputs fully formatted, ANSI-compliant queries, making it possible to test and share FQL queries directly in standard internet SQL tools.</p>

<p>@ is designed to sweeten the task of hand coding FQL. It makes it easy to build code that's exceptionally clear, and that can support complexity without becoming unreadable.</p>

<h3>Installing @</h3>

<p>@ is designed as a highly modular set of custom functions. It is completely self-contained, with no hooks or requirements other than the basic FileMaker 12 environment.Because of this, you can choose to simply grab the custom functions, pop them directly into any FileMaker 12 solutions, and get to work. </p>

<p>But there's a better way.</p>

<p>@ is fully integrated into the new <a href="http://www.modularfilemaker.org">Modular FileMaker project</a>, and the sample <a href="https://github.com/First" class="user-mention">@First</a> demo file contains a simple set of script wrappers that include documentation and installation tests you can use to ensure your @ installation is complete.</p>

<p>With this in mind, recommended installation of @ is to:</p>

<p>1) install the custom functions
2) install the Modular FileMaker scripts
3) run the "Test @ Installation" script to confirm that your installation is complete.</p>
